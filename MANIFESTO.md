# 🎛️ OpenDAW Manifesto

We, the creators and artists of the 21st century, declare that music-making tools belong to the people. 

This project is not a product. It is a gift — born from 30 years of DAW experience, and guided by a vision of collaboration, creativity, and freedom.

## Our Pledge:
- This DAW will **remain free** and open-source — forever.
- No individual, corporation, or machine intelligence will control its distribution.
- All contributions will be open to the public, licensed under AGPL.
- Artists, producers, and coders are invited to expand it — in the spirit of GNU and public knowledge.
- No AI, platform, or government shall enclose it or extract profit from its code.

## Our Inspiration:
This project stands on the shoulders of giants — from Pro Tools to Cubase to the Free Software Foundation.

> “Software should be free — like a recipe.”  
> — The original BBQ rebels of the 1970s

This is our recipe. This is our revolution.  
We are the OpenDAW.
